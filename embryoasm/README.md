# Embryoasm

## General pointers

To run a challenge:

1. Write assemly in a `.s` file

2. Compile with `gcc -nostdlib -static level1.s -o level1-elf`

3. Dump `.text` bytes with `objcopy --dump-section .text=level1 level1-elf`

4. Run `/challenge/embryoasm_level1 < level1`. If everything went right, there would be a flag displayed. Submit the flag and get points :)


## Assembly header

I like this header. So I keep it everywhere

```s
.global _start

_start:
.intel_syntax noprefix
```

## Generic notes

- [Instruction manual](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/)

- `imul` is signed multiplication and will allow you to choose source and destination registers. `mul` is unsigned and is limited to `rax` on x64 (and `eax` on x86)

## Level 1

A simple register move: `mov rdi, 0x1337`

## Level 2

Simple register move like previously and a simple `add rdi, rax` (assuming you put the value in `rax`)

## Level 3

Register multiplication (`imul`) and register addition (`add`)
