# embryogdb

A refresher on general debugging techniques used.

## Level 1

Basics of running programs in gdb

## Level 2

A simple `info registers`

## Level 3

You can examine the contents of memory using the `x/<n><u><f> <address>` parameterized command. In this format `<u>` is
the unit size to display, `<f>` is the format to display it in, and `<n>` is the number of elements to display. Valid
unit sizes are `b` (1 byte), `h` (2 bytes), `w` (4 bytes), and `g` (8 bytes). Valid formats are `d` (decimal), `x`
(hexadecimal), `s` (string) and `i` (instruction). The address can be specified using a register name, symbol name, or
absolute address. Additionally, you can supply mathematical expressions when specifying the address.

## Level 4

You can examine the contents of memory yet again. `x/32x $rbp` will give a good idea of the base pointer and `x/64x $rsp` will give a good idea of the stack frame. Now disassemble the main function and see the argument to `rsi` of the `read` syscall. Depending on that and the memory profiling done, get the actual data.
