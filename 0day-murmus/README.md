# 0day Murmus CTF streams retracing

- Trying to retrace Murmus CTF 0day vulnerability research streams to probably think about my own methodology

## Radare 

Check out the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGPkc8Pu84)

### What we doing?

- One of the best places to look for memory corruption bugs is where `binary parsing` happens and radare does a lot of binary parsing through a lot of formats, so more chances of bugs cropping up.

### Set up the environment

- Pull the Ubuntu docker image: `sudo docker pull ubuntu`

- Open the environment: `sudo docker run -it ubuntu`

- Make a copy of the clean environment:

	- While in the container, grab the container ID through `docker ps`

	- Commit with `docker commit <containerID> <newImageName>

	- All other work now begins with `docker run -it <newImageName>`

- Building an image backup: `docker save radare2_testing > /home/manwe/Desktop/image.tar`

- Load the image from tar: `docker load < image.tar` and give decent name `docker image tag <oldname>:<oldtag>  <newname>:<newtag>`

### Build the target

- Before building radare2, install `make`, `gcc`

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2.git` and build radare normally. Check if it is working just fine.

- Check if the target is running fine: `rabin2` in this case.

### Build AFLPlusPlus

- `apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev automake git flex bison libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev python3-setuptools`

- `git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus.git`
