# Listing of previous compiler based work

Most are extensions of Institute based assignments :)

## Directory information

**MIPS_code_generator**: A flex+bison based MIPS machine code generator. Assumptions:

        - A very simple language. No attempt was made to remove conflicts (it's a boring process for hobbyists).

        - Limited to statements, conditions, loops, and a nested combination of the same

**LL(1)**: A LL(1) parser written in C++. The biggest TODO here is to allow input from a file (refer to `output.pdf` in `./LL(`) for a sample run).

**C_tokenizer**: A tokenizer written in C for Java source code



## MIPS Code Generator

Sample input: **./MIPS_code_generator/README.md**

**Shortcut taken**: A good generator would additionally maintain a list of temporary registers and involve a lot of load-store operations. So that must be added.

Output:
