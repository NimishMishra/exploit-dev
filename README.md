# Exploit Development


## General pointers

- **Code injection**: Sometimes, through natural mistake, a char* buffer can be treated as a function pointer. If somehow, things can be controlled to take the path where the function pointer is invoked, thereby executing the buffer. This, however, requires permission to execute stuff on the stack (`-z execstack` on `gcc`) which is not allowed in modern systems. Still, an attack vector.

- x86_64 has backward compatibility. For instance, rax is 64 bit, eax is 32 bit, ax is 16 bit, and al is 8 bit. These can be used to write shellcode with no null bytes.

## General exdev (exploit development)

- I haven't yet figured out how to actually go on the process. So here's the idea: Murmus CTF has a playlist of amazing streams for 0day research. Probably retracing the steps they took may give an insight on how to proceed. That's what `0day-murmus` is all about.
