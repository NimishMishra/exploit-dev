# Exploit Development

## General pointers

- **Code injection**: Sometimes, through natural mistake, a char* buffer can be treated as a function pointer. If somehow, things can be controlled to take the path where the function pointer is invoked, thereby executing the buffer. This, however, requires permissio to execute stuff on the stack (`-z execstack` on `gcc`) which is not allowed in modern systems. Still, an attack vector.
