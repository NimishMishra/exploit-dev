## WARNING

We are mad enough to deploy kernel modules here for trying to analyse memory internals. Please do not reproduce unless you know what you doing...

In order to compile a kernel module here, do the following:

- `make all` in the relevant directory
- `make clean` to remove everything

Then you can write literally anything related to memory mapping. Refer [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/mm-api.html)
