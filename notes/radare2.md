# Radare2

Great disassembler. Here's a quick look at what it can do.

- `r2 OBJECT_FILE`: launch an object file with radare2

- radare2 enters the program at the start of the text section

- `aaa`: automatically analyse and autoname functions

- `afl`: print all functions found by radare (`a` = analysis, `f`=functions, `l`=list those functions that are analysed)

- `?`: sort of radare's way of printing `--help` (ex `?`, `a?`)

- `s NAME_OF_FUNCTION`: to seek a particular function. `s main` goes to the main function location and begins execution there

- `pdf`: print disassembly of the current function

- `VV`: enter visual mode (with a nice flow execution graph). `p` to cycle through different representations. `arrow keys` to move around

- `i`: information about the file

- Inside `VV` mode, enter `afvn OLD_VARIABLE_NAME NEW_VARIABLE_NAME` to rename variables in the visual mode.

- Inside `VV` mode, enter `v!` to enter a cool command line display mode.

## As a disassembler

- `r2 -d OBJECT_FILE_NAME`: start the object file as in a disassembly

- `db ADDRESS` to enter a breakpoint.

- `dc`: continue execution unless hit a breakpoint
