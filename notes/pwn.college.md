**Linux permission model**: every process has a user ID and a group ID. Child processes inherit stuff from parent processes. Every file and directory is owned by a user and group. Recall 9 bits of the form `rwxrwxrwx`, the first three are of the user, the next three are of the user group, and the last three are of the non-user group.

Previlege escalation is all about escalating UIDs to UID 0. We use SUID binaries to change user permissions on linux. sudo, su, newgrp are kinds of SUID binaries. They insert additional bits into the linux permission model: SUID bit, SGID bit, and only Sticky bit. **SUID** and **GUID** are simple to understand: when set, the process attains the permissions of the binary being executed instead of the parent process. **Sticky** bits are used to ensure that shared directories give file removal permissions to users who added the file.

Types of UID and GID:
    - **Effective**
    - **Real**
    - **Saved** (more for dropping privileges)

`sudo chown root.root ./xxx`: lets the file be owned by user `root` and group `root`.

`sudo chmod u+s ./xxx`: adds the SUID bit to the file xxx. The file is now run with the permissions of the owner of the file.

Now when a user runs the binary `./xxx`, the **real** UID is still the UID of the user. What changes is the **effective** UID of the user, implying the user is effectively the root while running `./xxx` but not otherwise. However, the **effective** group ID is still that of the user's group because the GUID bit was not set.

`sudo chown g+s ./xxx`: sets the GUID bit.

Now the effective group ID is also root.

Privilege escalation involves finding a vulnerable privileged service and exploit that to escalate privileges.

von Neumann architecture is the most popular architecture, and it sees data and code as the same thing. Harvard architecure sees things differently. The main security problem caused is when data and code is all messed up
