# Basic Scripting

`/etc/shells` has a list of available shells on your systems. Some may just be symlinks to another shells (like `zsh` is sometimes a symlink). `which bash` to get the path of the shell that needs to be used while scripting.

## General pointers

- Use `/dev/null` to basically write something you wish to be retained nowhere (retained >= not even writing to stdout file descriptor 2).

- In case you wish to `grep` a flag from a help menu, do `grep "\-p"`. Basically `-` is treated as its own thing
