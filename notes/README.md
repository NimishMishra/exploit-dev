# General notes on exploitation

- To find security issues in software, one needs to understand how software works. Imagine how certain pieces of software could be written, which helps one thinks about bugs. You can't exploit software until you know how it works, how it may have written, and what purpose it solves.

- The `esp` refers to stack pointer in the 32 bit architecture, while `rsp` refers to the same thing in the 64 bit architecture. Similar are prefixes of `e` and `r` for other registers.

- Status flags (bits) live in a special register: `zero`, `carry`, `overflow` and so on.

- `call` uses the stack. It throws information about the calling function on the stack, which is used to come back.

- `info registers` to get information about all registers at the current breakpoint. `si` to step one instruction. `set $eax=0` to set certain value of the registers. YOu can change control flows in a program using such manipulations and explore other branches
