# C++ Stubs

A set of C++ stubs

## General pointers

- All C++ names are defined in a separate namespace (`std`) and the namespace must be used in a given program before we can use the names

- #include is a `preprocessor directive` which is used to include header files in a C++ source. `<>` means standard headers and the search for such a thing begins at the path defined in the environment. `#include "..."` implies the search begins from the directory the source is currently located.

- Header files may themselves have other includes within them, so we include a `#ifndef` directive that checks if the definition has been made somewhere else before. This is the conditional directive and evaluates to true or false.

```c
#ifndef FILENAME_H
#define FILENAME_H


#endif
```

A sister conditional directive is `ifdef`, that can compile a given code in different ways based upon what is defined.

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
....
#endif

- Some other preprocessing directives:

    - `__cplusplus` : automatically set when code is compiled using C++

    - `__STDC__`: automatically set when code is compiled using C

    - `__LINE__`: contains the current line number of the code being compiled

    - `__FILE__`: name of the current file being compiled

    - `__TIME__`: time of compilation

    - `__DATE__`: date of compilation

Compile with `g++ -DDEBUG .......`
```

- `assert()` from `#include <cassert>` is an implicit **true or exit** statement wherein either it is true or it sends an abort trap (a software abort interrupt).

- Namespaces are used by library vendors to prevent namespace pollution. Consider something like two names `assert()`: one from standard C++ installation and the other from a user. These will collide. So the difference is maintained through `std::assert()` and `user_defined_namespace::assert()`.

- File: `ifstream infile("....")` and `ofstream outfile(...);`

- Dynamic object allocation needs to be taken care of by the programmar, since for reasons very well explained in a compiler course, C++ is pooly suited to automated garbage collector.

- Private members of the class can only be accessed by only the member functions and the friends of the class.

### vectors

- If you do a `vector<int> sample(10);`, then all `push_back` will rather add the new elements to the end of the vector, rather than over-write it.

### OOP

- Implements information hiding (data abstraction), dynamic function binding, abstraction.

### Inline functions

- function calls are expensive. Inline functions allow you to let the function expand at the place of writing. It then becomes a direct memory access rather than a function call.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < array.size(); i++)

||
vv

for (int i = 0; i < array._size; i++)
```
